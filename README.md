## Overview

This project demonstrates a Splunk-based threat detection system that monitors and visualizes malicious activity across multiple sourcetypes. It includes dashboards, alerts, and reports for three common attack types:  

- **XSS Injection Attempts**  
- **Brute Force Login Attempts**  
- **Malware Activity**  

The project highlights data ingestion, advanced SPL queries, multi-sourcetype aggregation, alerting, and reporting, providing a strong example of SOC analyst skills.

## Dashboards

1. **Overview Dashboard** – Consolidates key metrics and visualizations for all attack types.  
2. **XSS Dashboard** – Displays XSS injection attempts by client IP.  
3. **Brute Force Dashboard** – Displays failed login attempts by source IP (RIP) and user.  
4. **Malware Dashboard** – Displays malware events by destination IP and port.
